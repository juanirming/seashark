This is the authoritative implementation of the C^ programming language. C^ is 100% syntax-agnostic and it doesn't care about what your code is trying to do. All code executes 100% error- and bug-free because C^ doesn't distinguish between success and failure. In fact, C^ cares so little about... anything that it will bite big chunks out of your source code every time you run it. If you agree with ancient wisdom such as "can't have bugs if you don't have code", C^ is the language for you.

The C^ interpreter was coded in Python because it's slow and that doesn't matter.

C^ will destroy your source code or whatever file you pass to it.
